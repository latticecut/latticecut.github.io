I have been intending to write a blog for some time.

This is to help me better understand my own ideas about the papers I read, talks I hear, and increasingly important, the social media threads I view.

As such, most of the material on this blog is just a reworking of other peoples ideas, perhaps in a different context, or with comparisons drawn with the work of others.

I hope it is all referenced correctly. To this end, I am interested in feedback and input on clarifications, corrections, errata, emendations and so forth.

This blog is primarily focused on my interest in the different mechanisms of invention, innovation and the evolution of technology. Artificial Intelligence features prominently.

Most of my recent discussions on this have been with colleagues at the UCL School of Management, where I teach courses on designing predictive systems (Machine Learning) and technology strategy.

As you can see from the time stamp this blog has really only been possible with the advent on LLMs!
