**Figure 8. Higher order systems. As a system moves towards later stages of maturity, it can become as supporting component for a higher order system. Here the ubiquity of A[7], with potential increase in availability and reduction in cost of consumption, enables the creation of a new component B.**

*basically not going to get away without going back to y-axis here*

*visibility as proxy for value*
*high order components built 'ontop' of others*

Implicitly, a higher order component is created, or revisited, at a later time
