I am a senior AI engineer and manager, entrepreneur, educator, and investor. 

I am interested in the intersection of philosophy of science, machine learning and business strategy.

I am a co-founder and investor at the venture builder [The Building Blocks](https://www.thebuildingblocks.com/)

I am a co-founder of [Deepflow.com](https://www.Deepflow.com) which is an orchestration layer that maps your workflows and automatically delegates tasks between humans and AI agents, letting teams scale output without adding headcount. 

I was co-founder of [Satalia.com](https://www.satalia.com/), a global leader in enterprise Artificial Intelligence and one of the UK’s fastest-growing tech companies, whose clients include BT, DFS, DS Smith, PwC, Gigaclear, Tesco and Unilever. The company was acquired in 2021 by WPP Plc[^WPP], a British multinational communications, advertising, technology company headquartered in London. 

I was also on the founding team of venture backed [Wearepopup.com](http://wearepopup.com/) that created the first online platform to execute a fully automated commercial real estate license in the UK. 

I retain active research and teaching roles. I was a jointly appointed Associate Professor at the [HSBC PKU Business School](https://english.phbs.pku.edu.cn/) and the [UCL School of Management](https://www.mgmt.ucl.ac.uk/), where I was inaugural Programme Director of the MSc in Business Analytics. 

I currently co/teach the following courses:

* [Predictive Analytics, MSc Business Analytics, UCL School of Management](http://www.mgmt.ucl.ac.uk/business-analytics#overview)
* [Innovation and Entrepreneurship in Europe, MBA BiMBA PKU UCL](https://www.mgmt.ucl.ac.uk/mba-peking-university)
* [Emerging Business Technologies, MBA BiMBA PKU UCL](https://en.bimba.pku.edu.cn/programmes/PKU_UCL_MBA/Curriculum_ucl/index.htm)

In 2021 I was asked to mentor at the Royal Academy of Engineering[^RAE], having served as a member of the Special Group for Entrepreneurship for the British Computer Society. I have mentored at the Wayra Academy and Techstars London. Previous projects include helping set up [IDEALondon](https://www.idealondon.co.uk/) innovation centre with Cisco and DC Thomson, now in its seventh year with affiliated start-ups raising upwards of £350m. 

I actively advise several startups and provide executive coaching on machine learning strategy. 

Current research interests include the use of data in the practise of law, contracting systems, anticipative regulation, industry mapping, data driven technology strategy and human-machine teaming.  

I am interested in creating value from science and developing relationships between commercial partners and academia.

I sit on the board or [ConceptionX](https://www.conceptionx.org), which helps discover the next generation of deeptech founders and help them launch research-backed startups focused on long-term impact. We call our founders venture scientists, at the intersection of research and tech.
